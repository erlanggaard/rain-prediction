# rain-prediction
Predict the next day's rain by training a classification model on the "RainTomorrow" target variable.

This data set contains approximately 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. Tomorrow is the target variable to predict. Meaning, will it rain the next day, yes or no?
